      Florence Nightingale was an English social reformer and statistician, and the founder of modern nursing.

Nightingale came to fame while serving as a trainer of nurses during the Crimean War, in which she organised care for wounded soldiers. She gave nursing a favourable reputation
and became an icon of Victorian culture, especially in the persona of "The Lady with the Lamp" making rounds of wounded soldiers at night.

Recent commentators have asserted Nightingale's Crimean War achievements were exaggerated by media at the time, but critics agree on the importance of her later work in
professionalising nursing roles for women.In 1860, Nightingale laid the foundation of professional nursing with the establishment of her nursing school
at St Thomas' Hospital in London. It was the first secular nursing school in the world, and is now part of King's College London. In recognition of her
pioneering work in nursing, the Nightingale Pledge taken by new nurses, and the Florence Nightingale Medal, the highest international distinction a nurse can achieve,
were named in her honour, and the annual International Nurses Day is celebrated on her birthday. Her social reforms included improving healthcare for all sections of
British society, advocating better hunger relief in India, helping to abolish prostitution laws that were harsh for women, and expanding the acceptable
forms of female participation in the workforce. Nightingale was a prodigious and versatile writer. In her lifetime, much of her published work was concerned with
spreading medical knowledge. Some of her tracts were written in simple English so that they could easily be understood by those with poor literary skills.
She was also a pioneer in the use of infographics, effectively using graphical presentations of statistical data. Much of her writing, including her extensive
work on religion and mysticism, has only been published posthumously.<p>
